# homework2 Responsiveness Portfolio

This is a homework assignment. In this homework assignment, I had to create a mobile responsive portfolio using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

For this assignment I use Bootstrap CSS Framework from https://getbootstrap.com/. With the use of Bootstrap I was able to understand how to layout a webpage using grids and positioning. I was also able to rapidly develop webpages for my websites using the elements provided by bootstrap.
